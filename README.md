## The Problem

There are now **33+ coding agents** that support the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com): Kiro, Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode, Cline, and many more. They all speak JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio. You can use them in terminals. You can use them in editors.

But what if you want a **custom web workspace**? A task board for your team? A domain-specific IDE? A deployment dashboard powered by an AI agent? You'd need to implement the protocol bridge yourself: parsing JSON-RPC streams, managing subprocesses, translating events into something a web frontend can render.

## The Solution

This project is a **protocol bridge** that sits between any ACP agent and any web frontend:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph agents["ACP Agents (33+)"]
        A1["kiro-cli"] ~~~ A2["claude-agent-acp"] ~~~ A3["codex"] ~~~ A4["gemini cli"] ~~~ A5["cursor"] ~~~ A6["ANY ACP binary"]
    end

    agents <-->|"JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio"| bridge

    subgraph bridge["This Bridge (Python / FastAPI)"]
        B1["AgentRunner"] ~~~ B2["AcpToAguiBridge"] ~~~ B3["SessionManager"]
    end

    bridge -->|"AG-UI Events over SSE"| frontends

    subgraph frontends["Your Frontend"]
        F1["Reference UI"] ~~~ F2["CopilotKit"] ~~~ F3["AG-UI HttpAgent"] ~~~ F4["Anything"]
    end

    style agents fill:#1e3a5f,stroke:#60a5fa,color:#fff
    style bridge fill:#3b1f6e,stroke:#a78bfa,color:#fff
    style frontends fill:#1a4731,stroke:#6ee7b7,color:#fff
```

Clone this repo, select your agent, and you have a working web UI with streaming chat, tool visualization, and human-in-the-loop approvals.

## Use Cases

This pattern works anywhere you want a purpose-built web interface on top of a coding agent:

- **Micro-app creation platforms** — let teams generate and iterate on apps through a web workspace instead of the terminal
- **Automated report generation** — give non-technical teams a UI to interact with agents that produce data summaries, analysis, or documents
- **Deployment dashboards** — surface agent-driven infrastructure changes with approval flows in a team-visible interface
- **Domain-specific IDEs** — build focused editing environments (e.g., config editors, pipeline builders) powered by an agent underneath
- **Internal tooling for non-engineering teams** — any workflow where the agent does the heavy lifting but the user shouldn't need to know CLI commands

Same agent underneath. Different frontend for each audience.

## Why AG-UI?

[AG-UI](https://docs.ag-ui.com) (Agent-User Interaction Protocol) is the open standard for connecting AI agents to frontends. Instead of rolling your own SSE/WebSocket protocol, you get:

- **~16 standard event types**: streaming chat, tool calls, state sync, generative UI, interrupts
- **Transport agnostic**: works over SSE, WebSockets, or webhooks
- **Rich ecosystem**: supported by CopilotKit, LangGraph, Google ADK, AWS Strands, Pydantic AI, and 20+ frameworks
- **Frontend SDKs**: TypeScript, Python, Kotlin, Go, Rust, and more
- **Human-in-the-loop built in**: pause, approve, reject, or redirect agent execution mid-flow

By emitting AG-UI events, your frontend becomes portable across the entire agent ecosystem. See [`docs/why-agui.md`](docs/why-agui.md) for a deep dive on what this unlocks: CopilotKit integration, shared state, generative UI, and more.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/namanrajpal/acp-to-agui.git
cd acp-to-agui
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3000**. Select your agent (Kiro, Claude, Codex, or OpenCode), enter a project path, and start chatting. The bridge spawns the agent subprocess, translates its output to AG-UI events, and streams them to the React frontend.

## Configuration

There are two ways to select an agent:

### 1. Frontend selector (per-session)

The workspace UI has an agent toggle on the project selector page. Pick Kiro, Claude, Codex, or OpenCode — the selected agent command is sent with the session creation request and the backend spawns that specific binary.

This means you can switch agents between sessions without restarting anything.

### 2. Default via `bridge.config.json`

The config file sets the fallback agent when no command is specified per-session:

```json
{
  "projectName": "acp-to-agui",
  "displayTitle": "ACP → AG-UI Bridge",
  "agentCommand": ["kiro-cli", "acp"],
  "backendPort": 8000,
  "corsOrigins": ["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:3001"]
}
```

### Supported agents

| Agent | Command | Auth |
|-------|---------|------|
| Kiro CLI | `["kiro-cli", "acp"]` | AWS Builder ID |
| Claude Agent | `["claude-agent-acp"]` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| Codex CLI | `["codex-acp"]` | ChatGPT subscription or API key |
| OpenCode | `["opencode", "acp"]` | OpenCode Zen or provider API key |
| Gemini CLI | `["gemini", "cli", "acp"]` | Google auth |
| Cursor | `["cursor", "--acp"]` | Cursor subscription |
| GitHub Copilot | `["github-copilot-cli", "--acp"]` | GitHub auth |
| Goose | `["goose", "--acp"]` | Provider API key |
| Any ACP binary | `["your-agent", "acp"]` | Varies |

### API-level control

You can also pass `agentCommand` directly when creating a session via REST:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v2/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"cwd": "/your/project", "agentCommand": ["claude-agent-acp"]}'
```

## Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph frontend["React Frontend (Vite)"]
        direction LR
        CP["ChatPanel"]
        AD["ApprovalDialog"]
        TC["ToolCard"]
        SS["SessionSidebar"]
    end

    frontend -->|"SSE stream + REST"| backend

    subgraph backend["Python Backend (FastAPI)"]
        SM["SessionManager"]
        BR["AcpToAguiBridge"]
        ST["SessionStore"]
        AR["AgentRunner"]
        PE["PolicyEngine"]
        API["REST APIs"]
        SM --> AR
        SM --> BR
        SM --> ST
        BR --> PE
    end

    AR <-->|"JSON-RPC 2.0 / stdio"| agent

    subgraph agent["ACP Agent (subprocess)"]
        AG["kiro-cli / claude-agent-acp / any"]
    end

    style frontend fill:#1a4731,stroke:#6ee7b7,color:#fff
    style backend fill:#3b1f6e,stroke:#a78bfa,color:#fff
    style agent fill:#1e3a5f,stroke:#60a5fa,color:#fff
```

## Protocol Translation

| ACP Event | AG-UI Event(s) | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| `agent_message_chunk` | `TEXT_MESSAGE_START` + `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` | Opens message on first chunk |
| `tool_call` | `TOOL_CALL_START` + `TOOL_CALL_ARGS` | Closes open text message first |
| `tool_call_update` | `TOOL_CALL_ARGS` or `TOOL_CALL_END` | Based on status field |
| `turn_end` | `TEXT_MESSAGE_END` + `TOOL_CALL_END`(s) + `RUN_FINISHED` | Closes everything |
| `session/request_permission` | `STATE_UPDATE` (approval pending) | Uses asyncio.Future for async bridge |
| Vendor extensions (`_*.dev/*`) | `CUSTOM` events | Normalized to `agent:*` namespace |

See [`docs/protocol-translation.md`](docs/protocol-translation.md) for the full mapping with diagrams.

## The Tricky Parts

ACP and AG-UI do not map one-to-one. These required a normalization layer:

**Tool Approvals:** ACP's SDK calls `request_permission()` and blocks waiting for a return value. But our approval comes asynchronously from a REST endpoint. We bridge this with `asyncio.Future`: the SDK callback awaits the future, the REST endpoint resolves it.

**Message Boundaries:** ACP streams `agent_message_chunk` continuously. AG-UI needs explicit `TEXT_MESSAGE_START` and `TEXT_MESSAGE_END` events. The bridge tracks open message state and auto-closes before tool calls or turn end.

**Vendor Extensions:** ACP agents send custom notifications (e.g., `_kiro.dev/mcp_servers_ready`). The SDK routes these to `ext_notification()`. We normalize them into `CUSTOM` AG-UI events with a clean `agent:*` namespace.

## Three Ways to Build Your Frontend

| Approach | How it consumes AG-UI | Lines of Code | Use When |
|----------|----------------------|--------------|----------|
| **Custom Workspace** (`example-frontends/custom-workspace-ui-demo/`) | Direct REST + raw SSE parsing | ~2000 | You want full control over every pixel |
| **CopilotKit** (`example-frontends/copilotkit-demo/`) | AG-UI via framework (zero UI code) | ~20 | You want to ship fast with production features |
| **AG-UI HttpAgent** (`example-frontends/httpagent-demo/`) | AG-UI via client library (you build UI) | ~50 | You want the raw protocol with your own UI framework |

## How It Works

1. **Select an agent** — via the UI toggle, the `agentCommand` API field, or the `bridge.config.json` default
2. **Create a session**: `POST /v2/tasks` spawns the agent subprocess, initializes ACP
3. **Start a run**: `POST /v2/tasks/{id}/run` sends your prompt via JSON-RPC
4. **Stream events**: `GET /v2/tasks/{id}/events?runId=...` returns AG-UI SSE stream
5. **Or use the standard endpoint**: `POST /ag-ui` (what CopilotKit and AG-UI HttpAgent use)
6. **Handle approvals**: `POST /v2/tasks/{id}/approval` resolves pending tool permissions
